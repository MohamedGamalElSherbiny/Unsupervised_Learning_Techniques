# About The Project:

This repository is about the different types of Unsupervised learning techniques.

# Getting Started:
## Libraries Needed:
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib.pyplot
3. SKlearn
4. Pandas

## Contents:
### In the DBSCAN .ipynb file:

1. K-Means
2. Agglomerative Clustering
3. DBSCAN
4. GMM

It shows how each of them cluster the data depending on the distribution of the data.
It also calculates the error using both:

A. Inertia Score

B. Silhouette Score

### In the PCA file:

It shows how the PCA is calculated, and how the error is calculated using the elbow method.

### In the Naive Bayes file:

It shows how the Naive Bayes method is used.

It also shows an example of a sentimental analysis process.
